# In name of Allah

## Introduction
We want a simple app to get events of a specific calendar, and add events to it through google calendar APIs. It is consisted of a simple page which shows a lazy loaded list of events with following description: 
- event description
- event name
- due date
- repeat 

and also a floating action button in the bottom of page which opens a modal that gets the cited fields, and creates a new event (must be created in google calendar).

### Note
It is highly recommended to use flutter BLoC pattern.

## Expectations

So What does matter to us?
- a clean structure of codebase
